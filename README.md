# Tower-of-Eightness

Welcome to my play project of a homebrew computer based on the 6502 CPU used in many many home computers of the 80's.  This isn't meant to be a guide to how you should build a 6502 based computer but it is meant to be fun and it does work.  I had never done one before so there's lots to improve upon I'm sure and I would love to hear of any exploits or builds similar to or the same as mine.

P.S.  I am planning to bring BBC BASIC to this system as it's sooooo good.

P.P.S.  I will be continuing to develop this machine for some time especially over weekends.

Have Fun!
