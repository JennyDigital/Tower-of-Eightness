Burn this to the GAL22V10D on the AY soundcard Version 1.

This bridges the gap between the 6502 control signals and what the AY-3-8912A soundchip expects.

It should be noted however that the version 1 soundcard doesn't have support on the Tower of Eightness and is thus depreciated.  This was done to permit operation at 4MHz.

Kind Regards,
