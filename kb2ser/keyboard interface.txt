I have slightly modified Grant Searle's keyboard interface software to make it ToE compatible.  This is what you need to get going.  Some years ago I emailed him asking permission, and he did not reply so here it is but if he asks me to take it down, I shall comply.

Also included is a little script to burn it to the chip with no mess or fuss from the command line.  All you do is run the bash script from within the Prebuilt folder.

The command is as follows:-

./burn_kb2ser.sh
