This board art is only for the bottom side.  I'm eager to get my projects out fast and make my boards single sided (usually), adding links to the topside where neccesary for which the EAGLE files will let you see where they go.  Some of my newer boards can't easily be made single sided and as such may have to be fabricated with great care or many bodgewires.  Those boards don't have pre-made board mask art here, but the EAGLE files are included.

Have Fun,
