This is where the documentation as is right now.  Please note, this is a work-in-progress and things might change, or even break if I miss something.

The Tower of Eightness has a modified version of EhBASIC, formally called TowerBASIC for it's Tower of Eightness supporting modifications and additions.  Any updates to EhBASIC that are offered up will be considered for use based on my personal perception of benefit to stability, bug fixes and desireable features, but this project is out there for everyone so don't let me stop you making your own custom system.

In the meantime, go and checkout the EhBASIC V2.22 repository https://github.com/jefftranter/6502/tree/master/asm/ehbasic and Grant Searle's derivative of Daryl Rictor's video generator.  I've not published it here because I would need permission to do so and he does such a good job on his website anyway.

A final word of advice, EhBASIC is free but not copyright free.  In a not-for-profit situation such as mine I can use it but I can't sell it.  Please do your reading as I don't want to upset anyone.
